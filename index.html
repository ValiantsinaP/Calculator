        <p class="text">Whether we like it or not, money is at the center of our lives and everything that we do. We need it to buy food to eat, get around to the places we want to go, pay for the homes we live in, and support those that we love. Understanding how money works allows us to put ourselves in the best position to succeed. It also aids in avoiding problems in life, like going into debt, having a poor credit score, and having little financial flexibility. </p>
